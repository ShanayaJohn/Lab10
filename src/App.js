      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <p>This was a complex process to understand. To install and run react on my computer, I had to install node.js.</p>
      <h2>Building</h2>
      <p>To create this website, used the vscode with the command: "upx create-react-app name". 
        After multiple installing, I was given a template which I edited to create this website. 
        I used basic html tag to create the "hello world" heading and this explanation. </p>
      <h2> Challenges</h2>
      <p>The main challenge was understand the installation process and how to host my website on a free server. 
        To solve this I consulted alot of Youtube videos. </p>
    </div>
